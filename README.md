# hello-p5.js
Example repo for a [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) project

A basic p5.js project contains the following:

* index.html - The primary html document
* sketch.js - The sketch
* style.css - Basic styling for displaying in the browser
* README.md - A markdown file for providing additional information about the sketch

A project that uses additional .js files or libraries can be organized using folders. Note, if you download files written in the [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/), the unzipped folder will contain all source files in the same directory by default.

While, it's possible to put everything into a single index.html file, I advise against it since you are mostly working on the contents of script.js.
